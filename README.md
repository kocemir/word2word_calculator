# word2word_calculator

In this project, I have created a calculator as a user interface(on QT Designer) which gives ability to the user to perform four main operations ( addition, substraction, multiplication, division ) with words. If the user enters two words/sentences of numbers, according to the choice of operation, result will be printed as a word/sentence. It is mainly done in Turkish but I supplied a language choice. If you switch language from Turkish to English, you can make similar operations in English as well. **I set the maximum value for given numbers as 999.999 . You should be careful while performing an operations since the maximum of result is maxINT_32.** \

**For instance** \

**number1** =  " five thousand twelve " \
**number2**: "three hundred" \
**result** : "five thousand three hundred twelve "  for **summation** .
