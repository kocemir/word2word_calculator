# word2word_calculator

In this project, I have created a calculator as user interface(on QT Designer) which gives the user to do four main operations ( addition, substraction, multiplication, division ) with words. If the user enters\
two words/sentences of numbers, according to the choice of operation, result will be printed as a word/sentence. It is mainly done in Turkish but I supplied a language choice.
If you switch language from Turkish to English, you can make similar operations in English as well.

Warnings : The largest value for number 1 and 2 is  999.999 and the greates result is the maximum value of  INT_32. Please do your operations according to this warning. 

For instance : 
number1: " five thousand twelve "
number2: "three hundred" 
operation : addition 
result : "five thousand three hundred twelve "
